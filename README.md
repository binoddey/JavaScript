# JavaScript Course 🚀

A structured and continuously evolving repository documenting my **JavaScript learning journey** — from core fundamentals to practical implementation.

This repository serves as a **single source of truth** for concepts I learn, practice files I create, and patterns I experiment with while building a strong foundation in JavaScript for real-world development.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Build **strong JavaScript fundamentals**
- Practice concepts with **clean, readable code**
- Create a **public learning log** for consistency and accountability
- Develop a reference base for **interviews, projects, and revision**

This is not a tutorial repo — it’s a **hands-on learning workspace**.

- Topic-wise practice files (functions, loops, arrays, objects, etc.)
